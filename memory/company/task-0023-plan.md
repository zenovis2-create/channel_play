# Task Plan

Task ID: task-0023
Status: completed
Suggested agent: coding_specialist
Suggested reviewer: critic_reviewer
Required evidence: pure in-memory validator tests, canonical-field and nonfinite rejection tests, token/origin/body-size API tests, escaped Studio UI contract tests, JavaScript syntax check, Chrome runtime proof, full Python suite, unchanged manifest and receipt hashes, and findings-first review

## Request

Add a loopback-token-protected Studio preview endpoint and UI for validating dotted-key JSON answers for the 16 canonical Truth Pen owner decisions entirely in memory. Allow only canonical owner answer fields, merge into a deep copy of the current manifest, reuse the existing validator, cap request size, escape all results, return previewOnly true and contactAuthorized false even when valid, never write a manifest or receipt, and add API, security, UI, runtime, and full-suite evidence.

## Current Goal

8명이 접속하고 운영자가 포인트/아이템을 주며 OBS로 촬영 가능한 작은 3D 게임쇼 세트장

## MVP Scope

- 참가자 4~8명 접속
- 작은 3D 맵 1개
- 운영자 1명 접속
- 제한시간 30~40분
- 팀 구분
- 포인트 획득
- 상점 이용
- 아이템 3개 사용

## Style

- Korean-first planning and status language.
- Quiet production UI, visible evidence, no hidden automation.
- Every agent output should name the task, changed files, evidence, and next risk.

## Constraints

- Studio owns orchestration state; external AI tools are adapters.
- gdx1 is optional until health is verified.
- Unity work needs compile, playtest, screenshot, or receipt evidence.

## Forbidden Actions

- Do not mark done without evidence or receipt.
- Do not edit broad unrelated Unity folders.
- Do not re-enable Claude as a default adapter unless the user requests it.
- Do not use non-loopback Studio execution APIs without an explicit trusted-network setting.

## Standards Excerpts

### Evidence Standard

Path: memory/company/standards/evidence.md

# Evidence Standard

- No task is complete without a report, receipt, screenshot, compile log, or playtest note.
- Job receipts and review checkpoints can count as MVP evidence when they name the task.
- Verification must record what was accepted and what remains risky.

### Unity Scripts Standard

Path: memory/company/standards/unity_scripts.md

# Unity Scripts Standard

- Keep gameplay scripts under the task's allowed Unity script folder.
- Prefer small MonoBehaviour boundaries with explicit serialized fields.
- Do not introduce broad Unity package churn without a separate task.
- Every script change needs compile or playtest evidence.

### Unity Scene And Prefab Ownership Standard

Path: memory/company/standards/unity_scene_prefab_ownership.md

# Unity Scene And Prefab Ownership Standard

- One active owner per scene, prefab folder, or script system.
- Do not edit unrelated scenes or prefabs while implementing script-only tasks.
- Record ownership assumptions in the work order when touching Unity assets.

### Asset Import Standard

Path: memory/company/standards/asset_import.md

# Asset Import Standard

- Track source, license, import path, preview, and acceptance status for every asset.
- Keep Blender/2D-to-3D outputs in the asset pipeline until accepted.
- Imported assets need a short readability and scale check.
